# Continuous deployment of containerized applications in a Yandex Managed Service for Kubernetes速 cluster via GitLab

You can:

* Deploy your apps from a container in a [Managed Service for Kubernetes速](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-kubernetes) cluster via GitLab using Yandex Cloud tools (see [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-kubernetes/tutorials/gitlab-containers) for details).
* Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities in [Yandex Container Registry](https://yandex.cloud/docs/container-registry) when continuously deploying Managed Service for Kubernetes速 apps via GitLab (see [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-kubernetes/tutorials/sign-cr-with-cosign) for details).

Use these tutorials to learn how to prepare the infrastructure for Managed Service for Kubernetes速 and Container Registry using Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [k8s-and-registry-for-gitlab.tf](k8s-and-registry-for-gitlab.tf).
